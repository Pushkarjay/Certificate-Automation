# Certificate Download Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the "Failed to download certificate" error in the React frontend application.

## Root Cause
The React frontend was using incorrect API endpoints and parameters for downloading certificates:
- **Wrong endpoint**: Called `/certificates/file/{type}/{id}` instead of `/certificate-files/{refNo}/{format}`
- **Wrong parameters**: Used `certificateType` and `certificateId` instead of `referenceNumber`
- **Missing error handling**: No proper fallback mechanisms for different certificate formats

## Changes Made

### 1. API Utility (`src/utils/api.js`)
- ✅ Updated `getCertificateFile` to use correct endpoint: `/certificate-files/{refNo}/{format}`
- ✅ Added `getCertificateInfo` function for certificate metadata
- ✅ Improved error handling with meaningful error messages
- ✅ Reduced verbose console logging while keeping essential error logs

### 2. Certificate Display (`src/components/CertificateDisplay.js`)
- ✅ Fixed image loading to use `referenceNumber` parameter
- ✅ Added fallback logic: PNG → SVG → Mock certificate
- ✅ Updated download function to use PDF format for best quality
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with user-friendly toast messages
- ✅ Improved download process with proper cleanup

### 3. Certificate Verification (`src/pages/CertificateVerification.js`)
- ✅ Fixed download function to use correct API parameters
- ✅ Changed download format from PNG to PDF for better quality
- ✅ Added proper error logging for debugging

## Testing
- ✅ Verified API endpoints match backend implementation
- ✅ Tested with known certificate reference: `COMPLETION_FULL_G30_2025_0321`
- ✅ Confirmed PDF downloads work correctly
- ✅ Verified fallback mechanisms for image display

## Deployment
- ✅ Cleaned up all test files and debugging code
- ✅ Committed changes with descriptive commit message
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub repository

## Result
Certificate downloads now work correctly in the React frontend. Users can:
1. View certificates with proper image loading fallbacks
2. Download certificates in PDF format for best quality
3. Receive clear error messages if download fails
4. Experience improved performance with reduced logging

The fix ensures compatibility with the existing backend API structure and maintains backward compatibility.
